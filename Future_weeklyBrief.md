### DM-UY 1143 A Ideation and Prototyping

# [Future Project](Future.md)






  Create a written statement regarding what your Future project is going to be about. Where are you at the end of your card sorting? What sort of specific ideas arose from the interplay and ideation of your themes, descriptors and enabler cards?

### Semester Week 3a | Week 1: Future Project - Launch & Create Your Deck

1. Read Speculative Everything (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project, giving it context, as you are developing a speculative future. Do not skip it. Write a brief reflection and post under reflections (if you have not done so).

2. Review [The Future brief](Future.md). Do 1-2 expansive mind maps or lists, mapping out topics that you are interested in exploring for this project. They could be large, they could be small. These mind maps should be dense, deep and layered. They should not be cursory or limited by the page's edge. 


3. Review the Card Sorting Exercise, especially with reference to your mind maps. For this week, you are go through the process of creating your cards (ie, your Deck). You will complete the exercise next week.

4. Organize, label and extrapolate topics from your mind maps that you wish to explore in the Future Project. Can these fall under a larger topic? What might that be? Identify themes, topics, subjects, issues, concepts that you wish to use for your Card Sorting Exercise.

5. List your cards for your Card Sorting Exercise, including several for each of the following categories: theme, descriptor, and enabler cards. They do not have to work together. You should end up with 3-5 Themes cards, 5-8+ Enabler cards, and 8-15 Descriptor cards.

6. Set up a free Miro Account and create a board. Place all of your ideas on separate cards. Use a different color for each type of card - Theme, Enabler and Descriptors.


7. Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated, what is developing, where you are at and what questions do you have. What assumptions do you have?


#### Card Sorting exercise as outlined in class. Capture clear visual documentation of the exercise and post to your Process site (under the Future/Final tab),  along with a written reflection articulating the 3 outcomes that you generated.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Create (3-4) theme cards that are of interest to you, with reference to the Future project. Themes should be broad in scope. _This is the overarching thing that you will be looking at/studying in your world. Pick things that YOU are interested in_. Each of these 3 themes are to be separate, distinct, and spearate individual themes. There are some initial ones listed in Module 8. You. do. not. have. to. choose. from. these. Yet, these can be a reference to get you thinking. Create your own and write each one on it's own card.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, Flying cars is not a theme. That would be an ingredient in your world. That can be in your world, but it doesn't work as a theme. Instead a theme is much more broad, such as disability, genetics, memory, bioengineering, etc.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Choose a second color of card (or pen, or graphic) and create a set (5) of descriptor cards _for each theme_. That means 5 cards for each theme. *These descriptor cards should be adjective or traits or aspects with regards to each theme.* You should have at least 15 descriptor cards total by the end of this exercise.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Choose a different color of card (or pen, or graphic) and create at least 3 enabler cards for _each theme_. *These enabler cards describe what would need to occur to have your theme be put into motion/made a reality.* For example, if you had a theme of "nanorobots curing cancer", some enabler cards might be: Government backed research labs, bot cleanse centers (think: Dialysis Centers), universal health care vouchers, needle exchange programs, STEAM education begins in primary school.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Now is the fun part. Take a look at all of your cards. Lay all the themes and their cards out on the table and start to pull descriptor and enabler cards that interest you (choosing from all the themes). Start to make associations between the cards to form ideas. If you don’t see what you want on an existing card, add more descriptor and enabler cards in a miscellaneous group that is not attached to an existing theme.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the cards and play with them so they come together to form ideas for a project. Once you have an idea, write it on a new idea card. Do this multiple times and take photos of your idea cards. Try to play with the idea of contrast, and pairing complementary or opposite things together. Think also about what interests you in the existing themes, and why those themes are interesting. Look closely at the relationships between the elements of your newly created ideas.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you come up with a project idea, try to deconstruct it and organize different groups of descriptor and enabler cards that would be relevant to the same idea. 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>YOU SHOULD END UP WITH AT LEAST 3-5 IDEAS</strong>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Figure out which of these ideas speak most strongly to you. Make a ranked list of the idea cards. Ask yourself why you choose those cards, and why the idea is interesting to you. Take photos and notes and post to your process website.
