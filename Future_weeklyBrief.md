# [Future Project](Future.md)

### Semester Week 12b - 13a | Week 11: Future Project -

0. Work on the feedback you've been given (from me and your group). How is your project evolving?

1. Storyboard - work to develop and iterate your narrative on your storyboard

2. Artifact - work to evolve and develop your thinking about your artifact. Do you need another low-fi iteration to help you think through what this thing is and how it works? What are you learning from your prototypes?

3. Develop your Future Final Presentation. Show your process! 
    - Mind-map/brainstorm the mechanism you are using for your final presentation.
    - What research needs to be done? Do you need to look up some websites? Reference some texts? Interview someone? Visit a place and be a fly on the wall?
    - moodboards, personas, concept maps, and other visual research
    - storyboard - how is your final presentation going to happen?
    

### Semester Week 11b - 12a | Week 10: Future Project -

0. Post the outcome of the exercises and the feedback that you received. Post a reflection on how any of them are impacting your work. Be specific

1. Work on your storyboard for your narrative. Think about the important parts of the story, as well as the story's shape. Begin to sketch it out.

2. Work on your artifact. What did you learn from the last version? Create another version. Perhaps another low-fidelity (yet different material) or lowish.

3. Brainstorm different mechanisms of presenting your Final Presentation. Your world should be in the center. Branching out from that are options. This should be open and vast. Let your mind go. What do these things also make you think off? This brainstorm should be vast and deep.

4. Gather 2-3 resources for creating that Final Future Presentation. What might you need to know? What are you modelling your presentation off of?

### Semester Week 10b - 11a | Week 9: Future Project -

0. Post the outcome of the exercises and the feedback that you received.

1. Develop your project as you've been directed to in your weekly feedback. Fill the critical holes.

2. Develop a low-fi physical prototype of your artifact. Post images and reflect on the process.

3. Find 2-4 more research resources that are benefiting you, at the given point that you are at. What can you research to help give you ideas about your idea conflict (to elaborate it) and/or other aspects (ie categories) of your world that have not been developed with reference to your main concept. Remember: Copy, Transform, Combine.!

4. Work on your narrative, developing and iterating it.


### Semester Week 9b - 10a | Week 8: Future Project - 

0. Post the outcome of the exercises and the feedback that you received.

1. Develop your project as you've been directed to in your weekly feedback. Fill the critical holes.

2. Find 2-5 more research resources that are benefiting you, at the given point that you are at. What can you research to help give you ideas about your idea conflict (to elaborate it) and/or other aspects (ie categories) of your world that have not been developed with reference to your main concept. Remember: Copy, Transform, Combine.!

3. Sketch out a loose narrative for your world, with reference to your idea. How can you communicate your idea and the conflict of it? Consider the point it needs to be told from. It doesn't need to be the beginning of your world, nor the end. Perhaps it's some point in the middle. Also brainstorm what point of view this narrative is told from (no omniscient). Consider your personas and stakeholders. Or perhaps it's from another view point? Tell me about it.

4. Do a few pages of sketches exploring your artifact from different angles (physical and conceptual). How does this thing work? What is it's purpose? Consider detailed views and overall view (ie, bird)

5. Rest.

** note: High-Fideltiy Personas, Timelines and Stakeholders are required by April 21.**

** note: Midterm Self Evaluation Due April 14 **

** Did you watch one of the movies from the suggested list? If not, do one! **



### Semester Week 8b - 9a | Week 7: Future Project - 

0. Post the outcome of the exercises from class and a reflection. Tell me how your project is changing.

1. Refine your *concept map*. Make sure your concept map explores the main idea you are researching. Note that this is not your world, as your world is your setting! What is your focus/idea to explore through this world? Use the concept map to explore the mechanics of your idea within your world. Label the relationships. Do not be limited by the edge of the page.

2. Add to your *timeline*. Add events that are not solely related to your main idea, but also other events in your world. Secondly, explore the cause and effect of various events. If you've had a bit event related to your idea, what happened as a result of that? Go deeper and get specific. (Not just sweeping and big ideas.)

3. *Iterate and add to your personas.* These are general examples of people in your world. See the brief on github and the slides in Slack.


4. Begin to explore who are all the *stakeholders* in your world, with relation to your main idea/concept. Who are all these people and what is their relationship? Create a list that you will iterate and refine next week.

5. *Do a new mindmap, which explores different possible artifacts* for you to create from your world. This artifact can relate directly to your idea, but it does not have to. What are some other possibilities, give the world you've created and the interests that you have?

6. Reflection: How is your project developing? Where are you struggling? What do you need help with?

By this point, you should have a clear understanding of your main concept that is occuring in your world. You should have a sense of some general people from your world and their emotions, desires and struggles. The core people involved and effected by your concept should be coming clear. You should have an idea within time of what happened first, second, third. Perhaps you start to see possibilites of a few narratives emerging. If so, tell me what these narrartives are briefly. If not, tell me where your project needs support. Be specific in your questions


### Semester Week 7b - 8a | Week 6: Future Project - Mechanics of The Idea through your world 

Posts due to Process Site by 14:00 March 17

0.0  Catch up on previous exercises. Especially any from last week that you missed

0. Post the outcome of the ALL of the in-class exercises with a reflection. How can you use this to develop your world?

1. Iterate and develop your concept map. This is a great place to explore the mechanics of your idea through your world. Work on a digital platform so that you are not limited by the page's end. Explain the relationship between entries.

2. Gather 4 more resources - 2 for your IDEA & 2 for categories (not your idea). Annotate them and add them to your bibliography. Look at reputable new sources. What is going on today that you could remix strategically into your project??

3. Develop your Timeline further.

4. Develop a draft of 3 different Personas. These are 3 general people from your world.



### Semester Week 6b - 7a | Week 5: Future Project - Define Idea & Develop World Aspects II

0. Post the outcome of the class exercises. These include the questions posed to you and bad ideas from Monday, and the round robin. Write a reflection of how this went

1. Post a mind map exploring the central idea or problem that you are exploring through your world. Use the Idea Bug to further explore this idea.

2. Create a Hypothesis Statement or Problem Statement regarding your main idea/problem. Do 2 of the following exercises : the Assumption Map, 5 Why's and/or Premortem to further explore your idea through your world.

3. Start a concept map exploring your idea and world. This delves into the mechanics of your idea as well as how to is affected by the world. Remember that a concept map explores the relationships between entries. This will be interated over the next several weeks. Miro is helpful with this.


4. Start a timeline in relation to your idea and world. The timeline does not have to start from the present and extend to your world. It does not have to talk about how your world came into being. Yet, it should explore the cause and effect of events over time. This will be interated over the next several weeks. 

5. Mind map possible objects/artifacts you wish to make. This objects/artifacts is something from your world. It can be anything. It does not have to be the obvious. Yet, it should be meaningful with reference to some aspect or event.


### Semester Week 5b - 6a | Week 4: Future Project - Define Idea & Develop World Aspects

0. Post the out come of the class exercises. These are the questions posed to you from Monday and what was generated from _Investing In the Futures Game_. This includes the World Building of your group's world and the Identity prompts. How can you apply these experiences to your project and to strengthen your project?


1. Focus in on your _Idea_. What is it? You should be able to boil it down to 3-5 sentences. This is your Elevator Pitch/Presentation/Encapsulation. (The time it takes to ride in an elevator and convene to someone about your idea for your Future Project). These should be concise meaningful sentences. Post this to your Process Site.


2. Develop & Define your idea with reference to the exercises, feedback and class directives. This could include catching up, mind mapping, The Bug, 5 Why's, Assumption Map, How Might We and Premortem. If you have not already covered such things nor was your name called in class, you need to spend time in this step. This applies to about half of the class. Otherwise, continue below.


3. Identify 4-5 resources to inform your project. Three (3) may be able diverse aspects/vantage points of your idea. The rest are to be about one or two categories that you are defining within your world. See below. Add these to your [annotated bibliography](Future_Annotated_Bibliography.md).

4. Identifiy 6 of the 11 possibility categories below to use within your *WORLD* to develop it. Note that this is larger than your _idea_ and separate from it. Define them with reference to your world. Post about this and find a resource or two to add to your annotated bibliography.

Food Availability <br>
Information & Learning <br>
Transportation <br>
Climate <br>
Communication <br>
Government <br>
Living Conditions <br>
Work Conditions <br>
Economic System <br>
Health <br>
Shared Values<br>


5. Further Develop your Mood Board given the above developments


6. Between Feb 26 & March 9th Watch one of the Movies below. If your world is not far out in the future, push it further. One of these movies should help you see how to do this. Post about the movie you chose and how it's impacted your Future Project.


* REQ VIEWING: due 4/10: one of the Sci-Fi movies from the list:

  * Minority Report (2002)

### Semester Week 5a | Week 3: Future Project - Ideas & Research & Visuals

0. If you did not mix up ALL of your cards and generate 3-5 ideas, do that. See the Card Sorting Exercise at the bottom for more information - part D/ Step 5 in the slides in the Slack Resources. Document and post these images and a summary of your ideas.

1. Take one or two of your chosen ideas and use the Abstraction Laddering Technique to narrow (or broaden, in the rare case) the focus of your main idea. Sketch it out. Document and post images along with a summary.

2. Sketch out a priority map (personally excited vs important) and plot your idea and other aspects (perhaps from other ideas or other cards from the card sorting). Post the visual to your site.

3. Begin (or continue) a Mood Board which shows visual evidence of the idea you are choosing. This Mood Board should be diverse with content and images

4. Identify 3-4 contemporary resources that are suitable for your project. These should not all be about the same topics. Being your annotated bibliography, summarizing each of the resources specific value with reference towards your project.


### Semester Week 4 | Week 2: Future Project - Card Sorting 

1. If you did not do mind maps exploring themes, do them!

2. Expand on your deck: Your descriptor cards need to be specific with reference to your them. They describe your theme! Your enabler cards should also be specific as their are techniques, mechanisms, things and materials to make your theme a (future) reality.

3. CardSorting Exercise (see below): Do this exercise 2-3 times. The goal of this exercises is to find your core theme that you will explore through your world. It may take a couple go's to get the hang of it. The third time may help you land on something solid. DO THIS. Do not do it in one sitting. Spread it out. Let your brain rest. Students that rush this end up with projects they don't like, aren't supported and flat. You don't want this.

4. Write about each of your ideas, discussing them and summarizing them.

5. Where are you at, at the end of these exercises? What is your idea (or top ideas) so far (CardSorting)? What new developments did you realize from the work completed with your elements? 

6. What might you start researching to educate yourself on various topics within this world? List them and be specifc.

7. You may begin a Mood Board for this world, if you wish. You will be developing this over the next few weeks.



### Semester Week 3a | Week 1: Future Project - Launch & Create Your Deck

1. Read Speculative Everything (see Slack for the link) Chapter 1. This chapter will situate the project, giving it context, as you are developing a speculative future. Do not skip it. Write a brief reflection and post under reflections (if you have not done so).

2. Review [The Future brief](Future.md). Do 1-2 expansive mind maps or lists, mapping out topics that you are interested in exploring for this project. They could be large, they could be small. These mind maps should be dense, deep and layered. They should not be cursory or limited by the page's edge. 


3. Review the Card Sorting Exercise, especially with reference to your mind maps. For this week, you are go through the process of creating your cards (ie, your Deck). You will complete the exercise next week.

4. Organize, label and extrapolate topics from your mind maps that you wish to explore in the Future Project. Can these fall under a larger topic? What might that be? Identify themes, topics, subjects, issues, concepts that you wish to use for your Card Sorting Exercise.

5. List your cards for your Card Sorting Exercise, including several for each of the following categories: theme, descriptor, and enabler cards. They do not have to work together. You should end up with 3-5 Themes cards, 5-8+ Enabler cards, and 8-15 Descriptor cards.

6. Set up a free Miro Account and create a board. Place all of your ideas on separate cards. Use a different color for each type of card - Theme, Enabler and Descriptors.


7. Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated, what is developing, where you are at and what questions do you have. What assumptions do you have?

 Create a written statement regarding what your Future project is going to be about. Where are you at the end of your card sorting? What sort of specific ideas arose from the interplay and ideation of your themes, descriptors and enabler cards?


#### Card Sorting exercise as outlined in class. Capture clear visual documentation of the exercise and post to your Process site (under the Future/Final tab),  along with a written reflection articulating the 3 outcomes that you generated.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Create (3-4) theme cards that are of interest to you, with reference to the Future project. Themes should be broad in scope. _This is the overarching thing that you will be looking at/studying in your world. Pick things that YOU are interested in_. Each of these 3 themes are to be separate, distinct, and spearate individual themes. There are some initial ones listed in Module 8. You. do. not. have. to. choose. from. these. Yet, these can be a reference to get you thinking. Create your own and write each one on it's own card.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, Flying cars is not a theme. That would be an ingredient in your world. That can be in your world, but it doesn't work as a theme. Instead a theme is much more broad, such as disability, genetics, memory, bioengineering, etc.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Choose a second color of card (or pen, or graphic) and create a set (5+) of descriptor cards _for each theme_. That means 5+ cards for each theme. *These descriptor cards should be adjective or traits or aspects with regards to each theme.* You should have at least 15 descriptor cards total by the end of this exercise.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Choose a different color of card (or pen, or graphic) and create at least 3+ enabler cards for _each theme_. *These enabler cards describe what would need to occur to have your theme be put into motion/made a reality.* For example, if you had a theme of "nanorobots curing cancer", some enabler cards might be: Government backed research labs, bot cleanse centers (think: Dialysis Centers), universal health care vouchers, needle exchange programs, STEAM education begins in primary school.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Now is the fun part. Take a look at all of your cards. Lay all the themes and their cards out on the table and start to pull descriptor and enabler cards that interest you (choosing from all the themes). Start to make associations between the cards to form ideas. If you don’t see what you want on an existing card, add more descriptor and enabler cards in a miscellaneous group that is not attached to an existing theme.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the cards and play with them so they come together to form ideas for a project. Once you have an idea, write it on a new idea card. Do this multiple times and take photos of your idea cards. Try to play with the idea of contrast, and pairing complementary or opposite things together. Think also about what interests you in the existing themes, and why those themes are interesting. Look closely at the relationships between the elements of your newly created ideas.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you come up with a project idea, try to deconstruct it and organize different groups of descriptor and enabler cards that would be relevant to the same idea. 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>YOU SHOULD END UP WITH AT LEAST 3-5 IDEAS</strong>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Figure out which of these ideas speak most strongly to you. Make a ranked list of the idea cards. Ask yourself why you choose those cards, and why the idea is interesting to you. Take photos and notes and post to your process website.
