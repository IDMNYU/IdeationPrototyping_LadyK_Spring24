###### Sketch:

- Sketchbook: Warm up! Draw a page of 3-D forms playing with different types: oblique, Isometric, and two-point perspectives; with cubes, cylinders, trapezoids and cones.

- Sketchbook: Complete the exercise on p.64-65 2-3+ times to get comfortable with it. Use your straight edge.

- Sketchbook: Fill two to three pages +, by exploring the cube from elevations in space such as lower than the horizon line, different angles in relation to the horizon line, and different cubic forms.

- Sketchbook: Use the furniture magazine pages that you've been given in class and trace the 3D structures. (a sharpie on parchment or wax paper can help). Trace multiple structures. Scotch tape or glue stick these into your sketchbook.
