###### Sketch: Demonstration - Arrows,

Do the following and post by March 10. you have two weeks to work on each of them.

- Review & Warm Up: Review page 76-79 for drawing a rectilinear plane in flat orthographic view, one-point perspective (using one vanishing point), and two-point perspective (using two vanishing points) and sketch a few different one point perspective grids of different triangles + rects and two point perspective grids

- Sketch: Now, combine the curved planes with the rectilinear planes. Try a simple curve, a compound curve, and a combination of simple and compan curves over a rectilinear plane (see page 78 Demonstration)! <--- after doing the above, try this!

 -  Sketch: Try some complex wrinkled, faceted, or wavy surfaces by projecting vertical lines from the intersection of the grid lines on the flat plane. (see page 79 Demonstration)

- Sketchbook: Developing on the curved planes, draw a half page of arrows which curve and curl through space (orthographic views). See the white and grey arrows as examples and page 85.
