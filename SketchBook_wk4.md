###### Sketch: Orthographic & Curved Planes

- WARM UP: Sketchbook: Sketch a page freehand in two-point perspective, sketching planes at a variety of angles (See "FreeHanding Perspective").

- WARM UP: Sketchbook: Sketch a page of simple cube forms and envision how each cube might open or move. (see pg 71 - Orthographic Projections).

 - Sketchbook: Fill a page exploring curvilinear lines and forms. Draw a series of fair curves towards your body. Draw another series of fair curves away from your body. Notice the difference in control, regarding your body position.

 - Sketchbook: Practice drawing curved planes. Fill a page drawing ribbons. Think of the fair curves, using minimal distortion, and only curved on two edges. Think of how gravity would be working on this ribbon. Play with line weight and the contour lines. Consider drawing light interior lines to show the contour of the distorted surface.

 - Sketchbook: Follow the instructions on page 76-79 for drawing a rectilinear plane in flat orthographic view, one-point perspective (using one vanishing point), and two-point perspective (using two vanishing points)
