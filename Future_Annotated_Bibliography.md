# Future Project Annotated Bibliography

As part of your final deliverables, produce a formatted document (web page/blog post or pdf), that shows all of the resources USED to strength and further your project.

This includes both your idea and the 6 categories you chose for your world.

Each annotation must discuss:
 1. What they are about 
 2. the value they bring to your project specifically. 
This includes their importance with reference to your project and how it fits in to your world.
